I-I-I, I've been keeping secrets from you dear
There's things of me are
Scared and you're my fear
The crack goes in the ground
And you-ou-ou, you've been
Coming closer to the edge
Wonder what goes on in my head
And so I shut you out

And I guess that we don't
Need to be falling apart
But you will always have a
Special place in my heart
I never wanted this to end
Can you forgive me friend?

'Cause I fell in the hole
In the hole, in the hole
My heart was turning cold
Turning cold, turning cold
I never wanted this to end
Can you forgive me friend?

And I-I-I, I promised you that
We would never change
That you and me would
Always stay the same
How I let you down

And I guess that we don't
Need to be falling apart
But you will always have a
Special place in my heart
I never wanted this to end
Can you forgive me friend?

'Cause I fell in the hole
In the hole, in the hole
My heart was turning cold
Turning cold, turning cold
I never wanted this to end
Can you forgive me friend?

Forgive me friend
Forgive me friend
Forgive my ugly heart

Forgive me friend
Forgive me friend
Forgive my ugly heart
